# auto-car
an adaptation/modification that allows a vehicle drive itself when instructed.

I don't know much more about this project like the language to use but our first goal will probably to get it working
personally my code will never be finished, i should also note that i've never written src code

i'm an advanced user with some stuff like recognizing CLI output but mostly a noob with most things especially CLI

Dave (aka: donkey)

Update:
i should have included everything
as i'm a linux user this project will be unix/linux based and will have no licence so no licence restrictions

as a linux user as we know how most stuff works, each "donkey auto-car" can be customized according by CLI flags and will probably involve using a doner vehicle

this donor vehicle can be anything from a car to a bus, whatever you like

and possibly involving satillites to take overhead snapshots like for example going around a corner to see if somthing is coming the other way

as linux is also stable hopefully this will be the first of many projects where linux proves both iself and is users DO generally know how stuff works
